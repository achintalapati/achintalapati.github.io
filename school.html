          <h1>WPI</h1>
          <p>I'm a sophomore at WPI, double majoring in Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering. I originally got interested in computer science after watching the movie
            The Social Network with my parents when I was in 5th grade. I was fascinated by the scene of Mark Zuckerberg building FaceMash in his dorm room in what seemed like a couple hours.
            It amazed me that I had the ability to create something that could be accessible to anyone in the world. That summer, after some help from my mom and some online tutorials, I build
            my first website. <br><br>Later on, I wanted to learn more about how code actually interacted with hardware to influence things in the physical world, which was what got me into electrical
            engineering. At WPI I have gotten to dive into the world of computer science, learning about systems programming and algorithms and the ways they can be used to solve real world problems.
            This year, I am taking a bunch of electrical engineering courses, and I'm excited to finally get an understanding of how I can use my code to interface with hardware and create things to
            help me in the real world.</p>

          <h1>Mass <br>Academy</h1>
          <p>For my junior and senior years of high school, I attended the Massachusetts Academy of Math & Science. Mass Academy is a public high school for grades 11 and 12 that places an emphasis
            on math and science through project based learning. During junior year, I had the opportunity to do my own research project on possible therapies for Alzheimer's disease, create an app
            with my friends to teach young adults about local and state government, and work on an assistive technology device for wheelchair users to easily clear snow in their paths. These
            experiences were invaluable, as they gave me an opportunity to actually help out the community and make an immediate impact. I also got to learn how to conduct my own research and got to delve
            deep into a topic that I found interesting. <br><br>Senior year at Mass Academy is unlike senior years at most schools. The school is connected to WPI, so that Mass Academy seniors
            actually get to take college classes up at WPI. During each term, we were required to take three classes: one humanities, one math, and one science. For my humanities classes I mainly
            focused on classes that were writing heavy, as I really wanted to improve my writing. For my math classes, I got to take Calculus III & IV during my first 2 terms because I had taken the
            AP Calc BC exam during my junior year. I also took Discrete Math and Ordinary Differential equations during my senior year. My favorite classes were my computer science classes. The first few
            intro classes weren't too interesting, as they generally covered material I had learned earlier, but the classes I took in my second semester were great. I got to take Systems Programming
            Concepts, which was really cool because I got a much better understanding and appreciation for memory management in computers. I also took Algorithms, which was probably my favorite class
            that I took my during senior year. In that class we got to dive into a variety of different algorithms and how they each worked. The homework was always interesting and challenging, and the
            final project for the class was really fun. For my groups final project, we implemented our own version of a Linear Probing Hash Table and analyzed its effiicency with different resize
            multipliers and other factors.</p>
